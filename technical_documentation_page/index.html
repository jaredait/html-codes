                    <p>C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it's also simple and easy to learn. The curly brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++, Java or JavaScript. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to work productively in C# within a short time. C# provides powerful features such as nullable types, delegates, lambda expressions, pattern matching, and safe direct memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.</p>
                    <p>C# makes it easy to develop software components through several innovative language constructs, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.</li>
                        <li>Properties, which serve as accessors for private member variables.</li>
                        <li>Attributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time.</li>
                        <li>Inline XML documentation comments.</li>
                        <li>Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which provides built-in query capabilities across different kinds of data sources.</li>
                        <li>Pattern matching, which enables control flow by inspecting data types and values.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>
                    <code style="white-space:pre;">
using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}

                <p>There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. Variables of value types directly contain their data whereas variables of reference types store references to their data, the latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible for two variables to reference the same object and possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one to affect the other (except for ref and out parameter variables).</p>
                <p>An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of unicode characters without any whitespace.</p>

                    <p>The key organizational concepts in C# are programs, namespaces, types, members, and assemblies. Programs declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes, structs, and interfaces are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members. When C# programs are compiled, they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically have the file extension .exe or .dll, depending on whether they implement applications or libraries, respectively.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>C# is a strongly typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. The .NET class library defines a set of built-in numeric types as well as more complex types that represent a wide variety of logical constructs, such as the file system, network connections, collections and arrays of objects, and dates. A typical C# program uses types from the class library as well as user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.</p>
                    <p>The information stored in a type can include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The storage space that a variable of the type requires.</li>
                        <li>The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.</li>
                        <li>The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.</li>
                        <li>The base type it inherits from.</li>
                        <li>The location where the memory for variables will be allocated at run time.</li>
                        <li>The kinds of operations that are permitted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The compiler uses type information to make sure that all operations that are performed in your code are type safe. For example, if you declare a variable of type int, the compiler allows you to use the variable in addition and subtraction operations. If you try to perform those same operations on a variable of type bool, the compiler generates an error, as shown in the following example:</p>
                    <code>
int a = 5;
int b = a + 2; //OK

bool test = true;
  
// Error. Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'.
int c = a + test;
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>When you declare a variable or constant in a program, you must either specify its type or use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type. The following example shows some variable declarations that use both built-in numeric types and complex user-defined types:</p>
                    <code>
    // Declaration only:
    float temperature;
    string name;
    MyClass myClass;
    
    // Declaration with initializers (four examples):
    char firstLetter = 'C';
    var limit = 3;
    int[] source = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    var query = from item in source
                where item <= limit
                select item
                    </code>
                    <p>The types of method parameters and return values are specified in the method signature. The following signature shows a method that requires an int as an input argument and returns a string:</p>
                    <code>
    public string GetName(int ID)
    {
        if (ID < names.Length)
            return names[ID];
        else
            return String.Empty;
    }
    private string[] names = { "Spencer", "Sally", "Doug" };
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>A type that is defined as a class is a reference type. At run time, when you declare a variable of a reference type, the variable contains the value null until you explicitly create an instance of the class by using the new operator, or assign it an object of a compatible type that may have been created elsewhere, as shown in the following example:</p>
                    <code>
    //Declaring an object of type MyClass.
    MyClass mc = new MyClass();
    
    //Declaring another object of the same type, assigning it the value of the first object.
    MyClass mc2 = mc;
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>Classes are declared by using the class keyword followed by a unique identifier, as shown in the following example:</p>
                    <code>
//[access modifier] - [class] - [identifier]
public class Customer
{
   // Fields, properties, methods and events go here...
}
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>Although they are sometimes used interchangeably, a class and an object are different things. A class defines a type of object, but it is not an object itself. An object is a concrete entity based on a class, and is sometimes referred to as an instance of a class.</p>
                    <p>Objects can be created by using the new keyword followed by the name of the class that the object will be based on, like this:</p>
                    <code>
Customer object1 = new Customer();
                    </code>
