                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Paul Oakenfold: </strong>The story is a legendary one: in the summer of 1987, Paul Oakenfold takes a trip to Ibiza, falls in love with the island and its sounds, comes home and transforms the UK dance landscape with his brand of Balearic house, defining a scene and a culture. His influence is astonishingly wide: he was a driving force behind acid house and trance, he released Carl Cox’s debut single on his legendary Perfecto label, he produced the Happy Mondays, he remixed Britney Spears, he’s toured with U2 – so on and so forth. His DJ residencies in the UK, back on the White Island and around the world established him as one of the finest selectors, influencers and artists we’ve ever seen. Simply a titan of dance music.</li></br>
                    <li><strong>Carl Cox: </strong>After more than three decades in the business, the endlessly versatile and influential Carl Cox is still at the top of his game. An unresting champion of underground sounds, he was at the forefront of the UK’s acid house rave explosion in the late 80s, delivering near-mythical sets at Danny Rampling’s Shoom. The following decade, he went on to drive the techno sound that still draws thousands of people to each of his performances. His 15-year residency at Space in Ibiza was a consistent highlight of the island’s summer hedonism, while his Carl Cox and Friends stage has graced some of the world’s biggest festivals. What’s more, he’s widely regarded as a solid bloke, too. </li></br>
                    <li><strong>Frankie Knuckles: </strong>House music starts with Frankie Knuckles. His productions in the 1980s and 90s gave birth to the sound, inspired by stripped-back disco but undeniably fresh and forward-looking, drawing in soul and European colour. His music sparked the engine for house to soar off and become the global phenomenon it is today (you can trace EDM, that all-conquering beast, back to Knuckles). As a DJ, first with his residency at the Warehouse club in Chicago and then later all over the world, he became known as a deep-diver, spinning cuts that nobody else would even find, let alone play to a dancefloor of people. A true innovator.</li></br>
                    <li><strong>Grandmaster Flash: </strong>Grandmaster Flash didn’t start hip hop – we’ve got Kool Herc to thank for that – but he made it his own and in turn inspired countless other DJs after him. In the 1970s and 80s, he pioneered the sounds that would come to dominate hip hop for years: the beat-mixing, the record scratching and the punch phrasing. As hip-hop began to permeate pop music and give rise to other genres, such as neo-soul, Flash’s fingerprints were still plain to see.</li></br>
                    <li><strong>David Guetta: </strong>The superstar DJ is a common concept now – Deadmau5, Tiesto and the late Avicii all proved how the person behind the decks can sell out stadiums – but no-one has shown how to use EDM to dominate the pop music sphere quite like David Guetta has. His knack for collaborating with musicians leading the pop zeitgeist and setting them off against accessible, dancefloor-filling anthems has helped him to sell millions of records. There can’t be many of us out there who haven’t had a Guetta song stuck in our heads at least once (willingly or otherwise). </li></br>
